## What is it? ##
One-Click Upload is a jQuery plugin that replaces the standard file input element, allowing you to use any link, image or element to be used for the purpose of bringing up the "file browse" dialogue. It completes the upload behind the scenes without refreshing the page, making it less obtrusive and easier to style than a standard upload form.
